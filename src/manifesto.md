# Knitting Data Communities

The focus of this manifesto is a group of overlapping communities sharing data about the natural
environment, although its aims, workflows and technologies will be relevant to other kinds of
inclusive data communities. Our communities comprise amateur and citizen scientists, professional
naturalists, academics, students, teachers, policymakers, Indigenous peoples and other kinds of
stakeholders.

## Going Where People Are

We emphasise helping different communities working with data in formats they are comfortable with,
with tools they are familiar with, even if these differ from professional norms in other communities.
An example of this is the [Maxwell Creek Watershed Project](https://transitionsaltspring.com/maxwell-creek-watershed-project/)
project undertaken with [Transition Salt Spring](https://transitionsaltspring.com/). 
which empowers naturalists with moderate technical skills to edit documents in simply structured
[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) format, of which the web output is then rewoven into an
interactive [scrollytelling interface](https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html).

Other examples might be extending standard spreadsheet interfaces such as those seen in Microsoft Excel and 

## Working with the real, overlapping structure of communities

Colin Clark and Ethan Winn have recently written on [Mesh Cooperativism - Toward Mycorrhizal (Infra)structure for the Cooperative
Movement](https://ica-ccr-athens.gr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mesh-Cooperativism-Toward-Mycorrhizal-Infrastructure-for-the-Cooperative-Movement_abstract.pdf),
making an analogy between the interpenetrating structure of fungal filaments (Mycorrhiza) connecting 
communities in overlapping groups of a range of sizes, and the goals of a Mesh Cooperativism movement,
seeking to empower emerging cooperative networks through a combination of shared infrastructure and
interoperable practice. An example of this is the 
[Data Communities for Inclusion](https://cifar.ca/ai/ai-and-society/cifar-solution-networks/data-communities-for-inclusion/)


## Empowering Communities to Own Their Infrastructure

We help communities to navigate the space of complex, proprietary solutions with high installation
and running costs, by weaving through them with simply structured data and easily redeployable, 
often static packages. An example of this is the embedding of visualisations from the 
[IMERSS portal](https://imerss.github.io/imerss-bioinfo/).
